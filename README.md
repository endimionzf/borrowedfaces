# FEȚE DE ÎMPRUMUT (BORROWED FACES)

## 💡 What Is This Project?

This is a web-based **interactive video art installation**.

It is presented as a fictional digital archive where an AI, tasked with indexing memories, begins to **hallucinate**. When a voice in the archive lacks a face, the AI offers the user a "borrowed face," exploring themes of identity and compromised memory.

## 🚀 How to Run It

This project is built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript and requires local media files.

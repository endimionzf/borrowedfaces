## 💡 What Is This Project?

This is a web-based **interactive video art installation**.

It is presented as a fictional digital archive where an AI, tasked with indexing memories, begins to **hallucinate**. When a voice in the archive lacks a face, the AI offers the user a "borrowed face," exploring themes of identity and compromised memory.

***
**Technology Note:** The visual content for the "borrowed faces" was created using **[LivePortrait](https://github.com/KlingTeam/LivePortrait)**.
